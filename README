This is a test project for Wunder Mobility.

I've completed the task implementing the following:
- MVP framework + Java native code
- Retrofit + Rxjava + Gson for consuming API
- Rxjava for handling some dataset(avoiding use of Asynctask in some cases as Rxjava pattern is more lifecycle aware)
- Google Maps for drawing the pins
- Small test case to parse location

1. Describe possible performance optimizations for your Code.


2. Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it?
I've used CompositeDisposable in splash screen page only.
As maintaining CompositeDisposable for different observers is quite tricky.
I think having all observer(api+datasets) under one composite disposable would be fun doing as we can initiate and destroy all together.
